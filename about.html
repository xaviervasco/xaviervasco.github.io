                <h1>Bibliography</h1><br>
                <p2>Xavier Vasco is an Australian architecture student based in Melbourne. He is pursuing a Master's in Architecture and a Master's in Cultural and Urban Heritage at the University of Melbourne. He has completed parts of his studies at UC Berkley and TU Delft.</p2>
<br><br>
<p2>His architectural work primarily focuses on themed architecture, mainly in New Classical and Gothic styles, exploring the relationship between visual expression and its socio-ecological impacts on our environment. His research interests focus on artificiality and nostalgia, exploring the integration of artificial acoustics and animatronics into everyday environments.</p2><br><br>

                <p2>Xavier also maintains an art practice, having exhibited in Australia, the United States, and Europe. His works have primarily concerned the production of sculptural objects as artificial facsimiles and theatrical props, utilising technical abilities in carpentry, metalwork, sculpture, computer-aided design, painting, and colouring.</p2>
